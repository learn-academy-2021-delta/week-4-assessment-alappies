# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer:
  Props stand for Properties in react. They are a way to come up with a method that can be passed between a parent and a child class.

  Researched answer:
  Props(short for properties),  are a "keyword" in react. Props can be set in your constructor and called on by children components. Props can only be set in the parent class, and information from your state can  be sent from the parent  to the  child component, but not vice versa using props. 


2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer:
  A DOM event is any time that a user interacts with the visable interface, ie: button clicking, typing somthing into a comment box or hovering over somthing.

  Researched answer:
  A Dom "Is always listening". A DOM event is anytime a user interacts with the DOM, that could be typing into a comment box , hovering over an element that will react, or clicking a button



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:
  Object oriented programming takes a step away from using logic and data the way that a computor operates and uses data types that are related to real life. 

  Researched answer:
  Object Oriented Programming (OOP) revolves around data and objects that are relatable versus function or logic. OOP came about due to applications becoming excessivly hard to maintain, one change in data could create an entire ripple effect in the program. OOP operates within the confines of methods and classes that are clearly defined.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer:
  The difference between a float and an integer in ruby is that Integers will only return whole values. If you introduce a decimal to your equations in Ruby, the return will be a float. 

  Researched answer:
  In ruby you can easily execute math functions using numbers or what Ruby refers to as Integers. Floats are Integers with a decimal value as Integers only return whole values. 



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer:
  Implicit means implied, so I'm assuming that most returns in Ruby are implied. But the question is most likely "What" is implied. 

  Researched answer:
  When using Ruby, if a return is not called, the return is implied 
  ie: def add(1,2)
  1 + 2
  end
  It will still return three.
